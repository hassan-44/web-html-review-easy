        <p> <h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </h3> 
             <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </i> might not be saturated in quests to the same extent of the other games on this list.<br /> But you’re given the freedom to interact with the NPCs - and their possessions, if you have sticky fingers - however you wish.
        
        </p>
        <!-- this is the first game-->

        <p> <h3>Mad Max: </h3> 
            <i> Mad Max </i> with your friendly associate Chumbucket firing jolly little rounds from your car-mounted machine gun. <br /> Or using a flamethrower to incinerate nearby War Boys.
       
       </p>
       <!--this is the second game-->

       <p> <h3> Terraria: </h3> 
        <i>Terraria </i> is so full of possibility that it verges on the sandbox/open world boundary. <br /> Build your home and defend it from the icky things that will try to knock the door down and suck your brains out of your nose.
   
   </p>
   <!-- this is the third game-->

   <p> <h3>  Just Cause 3: </h3> 
    <i> Just Cause 3’s </i> missions or NPCs, as they’re shallow at best. <br /> Despite this, there’s really nothing like parachuting towards the fast-approaching ground and then letting loose with a shotgun RPG.

<!-- this is the fourrth game-->
